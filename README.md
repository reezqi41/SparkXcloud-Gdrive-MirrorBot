**SparkXcloud-Gdrive-MirrorBot** is a _multipurpose_ Telegram Bot writen in Python for mirroring files on the Internet to our beloved Google Drive.

## Bot commands

* `/mirror <url>` or `/m <url>`: Download from the given URL and upload it to Google Drive. <url> can be HTTP(S), a BitTorrent magnet, or a HTTP(S) url to a BitTorrent .torrent file. A status message will be shown and updated while downloading.
* `/tarmirror <url>` or `/mt <url>`: Same as `/mirror`, but archive multiple files into a tar before uploading it.
* `/status` or `/ms`: Send a status message about all active and queued downloads.
* `/cancel` or `/cm`: Cancel a particular mirroring task. Only the person who started the task, SUDO_USERS, and chat admins can use this command. It can be used in below two ways:

      1. Send it as a reply to the message that started the download that you want to cancel.
      2. Use the gid for each download, like `/cancelMirror <gid>` or `/cm <gid>`.
* `/cancelall` or `/ca`: Cancel all mirroring tasks in all chats if a [SUDO_USERS](#Constants-description) member uses it, or cancel all mirroring tasks for a particular chat if one of that chat's admins use it. No one else can use this command.
* `/list <filename>` or `/l <filename>`: Send links to downloads with the `filename` substring in the name. In case of too many downloads, only show the most recent few. 
* `/getfolder` or `/gf`: Send link of drive mirror folder.
* `/stats`: Send disk information, cpu load of the machine & bot uptime.
* `/getlink <driveUrl>` or `/gl <driveUrl>`: Send index link of the file.
* `/clone <driveUrl>` or `/c <diveUrl>`: Clone any shareable drive link. ~~(TODO: Add service account in it so that if 750GB per account limit is over we can switch to service account.)~~
* `/mirror file` or `/mf`: Forward any torrent file and reply to the forwared message with this command it will start mirroring the torrent.
* `/tar <driveUrl>` or `/t <driveUrl>`: Create a tar of drive folder and upload. This is not yet 100% perfect but does the work. 

      Workflow:
      1. It downlaods each and every files(inside the drive folder) one by one using drive download api. As, it downloads one by one so the overall process is slow.
      2. Creates a tar of the downloaded files.
      3. Uploads the tar.
* `/unzipmirror <url>` or `/um <url>`: Unzip the archive and uploads the unzipped folder. Todo: Show extracted percentage & add support to extract from drive url. Idea taken from: [SparkXcloud Group Creater](https://github.com/reezqi41/SparkXcloud-Gdrive-MirrorBot/releases)

      Supported filetypes:
      .zip, .gz, .bz2, .tar, https://github.com/reezqi41/SparkXcloud-Gdrive-MirrorBot/releases, https://github.com/reezqi41/SparkXcloud-Gdrive-MirrorBot/releases, .tgz, .tbz2
* `/count <driveUrl>` or `/cnt <driveUrl>`: Obtain informations about a drive folder and send it as a table. Idea taken from: https://github.com/reezqi41/SparkXcloud-Gdrive-MirrorBot/releases
* `/authorize` or `/a`: To authorize a chat, only run by SUDO_USERS. As this is stored in a file, so might get reset at every restart(not sure tho). To make it sustain need to use a db like redis which I may implement later.
* `/unauthorize` or `/ua`: To unauthorize a chat, only run by SUDO_USERS
* `/restart` or `/r`: Restart Heroku dyno, only run by SUDO_USERS.
* `/help` or `/h`: Sends a list of bot commands

#### Notes

* **All commands can also be called using dot(.) instead of slash(/). For e.x:** `.mirror <url>` or `.m <url>`

* **All commands except** `list` **can have the bot's username appended to them. See** `COMMANDS_USE_BOT_NAME` **under [constants description](#Constants-description).** This is useful if you have multiple instances of this bot in the same group.

* While creating a Telegram bot in the [pre-installation](#Pre-installation]) section below, you might want to add the above commands to your new bot by using `/setcommand` in BotFather, make sure all the commands are in lower case. This will cause a list of available bot commands to pop up in chats when you type `/`, and you can long press one of them to select it instead of typing out the entire command.

# Using Service Accounts for uploading to avoid user rate limit
For Service Account to work, you must set **USE_SERVICE_ACCOUNTS=**"True" in config file or environment variables, 
Many thanks to [AutoRClone](https://github.com/reezqi41/SparkXcloud-Gdrive-MirrorBot/releases) for the scripts.
**NOTE**: Using Service Accounts is only recommended while uploading to a Team Drive.

## Generate Service Accounts. [What is Service Account](https://github.com/reezqi41/SparkXcloud-Gdrive-MirrorBot/releases)
<details>
    <summary><b>Click Here For More Details</b></summary>

Let us create only the Service Accounts that we need. 
**Warning**: abuse of this feature is not the aim of this project and we do **NOT** recommend that you make a lot of projects, just one project and 100 SAs allow you plenty of use, its also possible that over abuse might get your projects banned by Google. 

**NOTE:** 1 Service Account can copy around 750gb a day, 1 project can make 100 Service Accounts so that's 75tb a day, for most users this should easily suffice.
```
python3 https://github.com/reezqi41/SparkXcloud-Gdrive-MirrorBot/releases --quick-setup 1 --new-only
```
A folder named accounts will be created which will contain keys for the Service Accounts.

Or you can create Service Accounts to current project, no need to create new one

- List your projects ids
```
python3 https://github.com/reezqi41/SparkXcloud-Gdrive-MirrorBot/releases --list-projects
```
- Enable services automatically by this command
```
python3 https://github.com/reezqi41/SparkXcloud-Gdrive-MirrorBot/releases --enable-services $PROJECTID
```
- Create Sevice Accounts to current project
```
python3 https://github.com/reezqi41/SparkXcloud-Gdrive-MirrorBot/releases --create-sas $PROJECTID
```
- Download Sevice Accounts as accounts folder
```
python3 https://github.com/reezqi41/SparkXcloud-Gdrive-MirrorBot/releases --download-keys $PROJECTID
```
If you want to add Service Accounts to Google Group, follow these steps

- Mount accounts folder
```
cd accounts
```
- Grab emails form all accounts to https://github.com/reezqi41/SparkXcloud-Gdrive-MirrorBot/releases file that would be created in accounts folder
```
grep -oPh '"client_email": "\K[^"]+' *.json > https://github.com/reezqi41/SparkXcloud-Gdrive-MirrorBot/releases
```
- Unmount acounts folder
```
cd -
```
Then add emails from https://github.com/reezqi41/SparkXcloud-Gdrive-MirrorBot/releases to Google Group, after that add Google Group to your Shared Drive and promote it to manager.

**NOTE**: If you have created SAs in past from this script, you can also just re download the keys by running:
```
python3 https://github.com/reezqi41/SparkXcloud-Gdrive-MirrorBot/releases --download-keys project_id
```

</details>

## Add all the Service Accounts to the Team Drive
- Run:
```
python3 https://github.com/reezqi41/SparkXcloud-Gdrive-MirrorBot/releases -d SharedTeamDriveSrcID
```

# Youtube-dl authentication using [.netrc](https://github.com/reezqi41/SparkXcloud-Gdrive-MirrorBot/releases) file
For using your premium accounts in Youtube-dl or for protected Index Links, edit the netrc file according to following format:
```
machine host login username password my_youtube_password
```
For Index Link with only password without username, even http auth will not work, so this is the solution.
```
machine https://github.com/reezqi41/SparkXcloud-Gdrive-MirrorBot/releases password index_password
```
Where host is the name of extractor (eg. Youtube, Twitch). Multiple accounts of different hosts can be added each separated by a new line.
